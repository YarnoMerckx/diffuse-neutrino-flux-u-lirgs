# Diffuse-LIRG-Emission

The analytic_neutrino_flux file is used in the DataframeGOALS to compute the neutirno flux per source. The Dataframe file is then used in the Extrapolation file to compute the local IR generation rate. Moreover, the xi file is also used in the Extrapolation file to compute the redshift evolution parameter.
