# Diffuse-LIRG-Emission

The Analytic_neutrino_flux file is used in the Dataframe_GOALS to compute the neutirno flux per source. The Dataframe_GOALS file is then used in the Extrapolation file to compute the local IR generation rate. Moreover, the xi file is also used in the Extrapolation file to compute the redshift evolution parameter.
