# Diffuse High-Energy Neutrino Flux from ULIRGs

The `diffuse_lirg_prediction.ipynb` notebook presents predictions for the diffuse high-energy neutrino flux from LIRGs. These predictions are based on local estimates from a representative sample of ULIRGs. The local representative sample used in this work is the one used in a dedicated IceCube analysis of the ULIRG population [Astrophys.J. 926 (2022) 1, 59]. The source of information can be found in `ULIRG_selection.txt` and the relevant functions required to obtain flux estimates from these sources can be found in `diffuse_ulirg_extrapolation.py`.
