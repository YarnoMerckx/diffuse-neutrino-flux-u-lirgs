# Diffuse High-Energy Neutrino Flux from ULIRGs

The `diffuse_lirg_prediction.ipynb` notebook presents predictions for the diffuse high-energy neutrino flux from LIRGs. These predictions are based on local flux estimates derived from a representative sample of ULIRGs, selected in alignment with a dedicated IceCube analysis of the ULIRG population [Astrophys. J. 926 (2022) 1, 59].

Details on the selected sample are provided in `ULIRG_selection.txt`, and the functions used to compute flux estimates from these sources are implemented in `diffuse_ulirg_extrapolation.py`.
