# Diffuse High-Energy Neutrino Flux from LIRGs

The `diffuse_lirg_prediction.ipynb` notebook presents predictions for the diffuse high-energy neutrino flux from LIRGs. These predictions are based on local estimates from a representative sample of GOALS LIRGs. Source-specific information for the LIRGs can be found in the `Dataframes` folders and the analysis of the local representative sample in the `Completeness`folder. The relevant functions required to obtain flux estimates from these sources can be found in `diffuse_lirg_extrapolation.py`. To extrapolate the local predictions to diffuse estimates we use the framework outlined in:
